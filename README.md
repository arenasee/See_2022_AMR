# Amplicon-based Sequencing of AMR Gene Variants

Data analysis methods for filtration and analysis of samples taken from cattle rumen, fecal, soil, and floor surface samples. 

Data are AMR amplicon libraries (tetw, sul1, ermB). This repository contains the R commands run on the ASV count table produced from DADA2, sample metadata, and MEGARes database for annotations.
Analysis can be performed in any order as each file is a different gene.
